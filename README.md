# Zhiyuan-Xu-Jerry
I am Zhiyuan Xu, an international student from China and now pursuing a Bachelor's Degree majoring in Computer Science in University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA.
I have several projects that are used to demonstrate some programming languages as well as frontend and backend technologies. 
However, they are source codes that need and need to install several packages and frameworks (e.g. node.js) to be downloaded so as to run on your local computer.
# Packages and frameworks
Try run 'npm install' and 'npm run build' and set JDK, Tomcat and several databases to run.
